## Hi there 👋 I'm Manoj

**📊💅 Data beats Emotions**

I'm a **Data Scientist and AI Engineer** based in Hamburg, currently pursuing an MSc in Applied Data Science & Analytics. I design and ship end-to-end, production-ready ML systems that go far beyond experimental notebooks and actually move business metrics in the real world.

🗺️ My Journey (5️⃣ Years - Present)<br>
Bachelors in CSE --> Data Science Intern --> MSc in Data Science and Analytics --> Junior Data Scientist and AI Engineer @ AICOO

---

### 🚀 What I work on at AICOO - Chechout [Here](https://aicoo.ai)

- Where we build AI agents which connects to all the AI agents to Slack, Emails, etc which inturn increases effeciency in Project Management.
- I am building **Multi-agentic AI systems** for project and risk management, from architecture to deployed FastAPI services.
- This system analyzes incomming Emails to identify and filter out the emails containing maximum "Risk" and updates in the db.
---

### 🔧 Tech I use daily

- **Languages**: Python, SQL
- **ML & Data**: scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, basic deep learning frameworks
- **LLM & RAG**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines, AI agents, tool-calling, evaluation workflows
- **MLOps & Infra**: GitHub Actions/CI, containerized services, FastAPI-based microservices, basic cloud workflows
- **Analytics & BI**: Dashboards and reports for communicating results to both technical and non-technical stakeholders

---

### 📚 What I'm learning right now

- Statistical foundations for robust modeling and experiment design
- Advanced RAG architectures (evaluation, routing, observability)
- ML lifecycle automation (training, evaluation, CI/CD, monitoring, and deployment) for reliable, repeatable delivery
- Scalable ML systems: monitoring, alerting, and feedback loops in production

### 📂 Featured projects

- **Diabetic Retinopathy Detection**  
  End-to-end deep learning pipeline for classifying retinal fundus images into disease stages [research project](https://github.com/Manoj-Sh-AI/Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection-and-Clasification-System)

- **Multi-Agent RAG for Project Management**  
  Multi-agent pipeline that retrieves project knowledge, generates constrained resolution options, and integrates with existing workflows. [Example Project](https://github.com/Manoj-Sh-AI/Problem_Resolution_System_Using_RAG)

- **ML Lifecycle Automation**  
  Templates and scripts that automate training, evaluation, and deployment using CI/CD for faster, safer iterations

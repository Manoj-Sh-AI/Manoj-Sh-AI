## Hi there 👋 I’m Manoj

I’m a **Data Scientist and AI Engineer** based in Hamburg, currently pursuing an MSc in Applied Data Science & Analytics. I design and ship end-to-end, production-ready ML systems that go far beyond experimental notebooks and actually move business metrics in the real world.

---

### 🚀 What I work on

- Multi-agent RAG systems for project and risk management, from architecture to deployed FastAPI services.
- ML lifecycle automation (training, evaluation, CI/CD, monitoring, and deployment) for reliable, repeatable delivery.
- Deep learning pipelines for medical imaging, including diabetic retinopathy detection from retinal images.

---

### 🔧 Tech I use daily

- Languages: Python, SQL  
- ML & Data: scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, basic deep learning frameworks  
- LLM & RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines, AI agents, tool-calling, evaluation workflows  
- MLOps & Infra: GitHub Actions/CI, containerized services, FastAPI-based microservices, basic cloud workflows  
- Analytics & BI: Dashboards and reports for communicating results to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

---

### 📚 What I’m learning right now

- Statistical foundations for robust modeling and experiment design  
- Advanced RAG architectures (evaluation, routing, observability)  
- Scalable ML systems: monitoring, alerting, and feedback loops in production.

---

### 📂 Featured projects

- Diabetic Retinopathy Detection  
  End-to-end deep learning pipeline for classifying retinal fundus images into disease stages (research project).

- Multi-Agent RAG for Project Management  
  Multi-agent pipeline that retrieves project knowledge, generates constrained resolution options, and integrates with existing workflows.

- ML Lifecycle Automation  
  Templates and scripts that automate training, evaluation, and deployment using CI/CD for faster, safer iterations.

(You can pin these repositories on your GitHub profile so they appear right under this README.)

---

### 🤝 What I’m looking for

- Roles where I can own the **full ML lifecycle**: from data and problem framing to deployment, monitoring, and iteration.  
- Teams building practical RAG systems, AI agents, and data products that deliver measurable business impact.

If your team is working on data-driven products and needs someone who can turn messy data and vague ideas into production systems, I’d love to connect.

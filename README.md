## Hi there 👋 I'm Manoj

**📊💅 Data beats Emotions**

I'm a **Data Scientist and AI Engineer** based in Hamburg, currently pursuing an MSc in Applied Data Science & Analytics. I design and ship end-to-end, production-ready ML systems that go far beyond experimental notebooks and actually move business metrics in the real world.

---

### 🚀 What I work on

- Multi-agent RAG systems for project and risk management, from architecture to deployed FastAPI services
- ML lifecycle automation (training, evaluation, CI/CD, monitoring, and deployment) for reliable, repeatable delivery
- Deep learning pipelines for medical imaging, including diabetic retinopathy detection from retinal images

---

### 🔧 Tech I use daily

- **Languages**: Python, SQL
- **ML & Data**: scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, basic deep learning frameworks
- **LLM & RAG**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines, AI agents, tool-calling, evaluation workflows
- **MLOps & Infra**: GitHub Actions/CI, containerized services, FastAPI-based microservices, basic cloud workflows
- **Analytics & BI**: Dashboards and reports for communicating results to both technical and non-technical stakeholders

---

### 📚 What I'm learning right now

- Statistical foundations for robust modeling and experiment design
- Advanced RAG architectures (evaluation, routing, observability)
- Scalable ML systems: monitoring, alerting, and feedback loops in production

---

### 📂 Featured projects

- **Diabetic Retinopathy Detection**  
  End-to-end deep learning pipeline for classifying retinal fundus images into disease stages (research project)

- **Multi-Agent RAG for Project Management**  
  Multi-agent pipeline that retrieves project knowledge, generates constrained resolution options, and integrates with existing workflows

- **ML Lifecycle Automation**  
  Templates and scripts that automate training, evaluation, and deployment using CI/CD for faster, safer iterations

### 🤝 What I'm looking for

- Roles where I can own the **full ML lifecycle**: from data and problem framing to deployment, monitoring, and iteration
- Teams building practical RAG systems, AI agents, and data products that deliver measurable business impact

If your team is working on data-driven products and needs someone who can turn messy data and vague ideas into production systems, I'd love to connect.
